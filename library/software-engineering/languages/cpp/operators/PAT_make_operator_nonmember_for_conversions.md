# Make a Function Non-member When All Arguments Need Conversion

## Pattern Rule
**IF** an operator or function must allow implicit type conversion on every argument, including the left operand — as in mixed-mode arithmetic like `2 * oneHalf`
**THEN** make it a non-member function, because the implicit receiver argument of a member function is never eligible for implicit conversion.

## Do
- Implement the operator as a non-member taking all operands as parameters, so the compiler may convert any of them (turning the int 2 into a Rational).
- Keep it a non-member non-friend when the public interface suffices; the opposite of a member is a non-member, not a friend.

## Don't
- Don't leave such an operator a member: `oneHalf * 2` compiles but `2 * oneHalf` does not, because the receiver — the int 2 — cannot be converted to the class type.

## Checklist
- Does this operator need conversions on the left operand as well as the right?
- Is it a non-member so every operand is eligible for conversion?
- Did I avoid making it a friend when the public interface was enough?

## Notes
Only parameters in the parameter list are eligible for implicit conversion; the object a member function is invoked on (the receiver) never is. So a member `Rational::operator*` supports `oneHalf * 2` but not `2 * oneHalf`, breaking commutativity for mixed-mode arithmetic. Making operator* a non-member puts both operands in the parameter list, so the constructor-based int-to-Rational conversion applies to either. And since it needs only the public interface here, it should be a plain non-member, not a friend.
