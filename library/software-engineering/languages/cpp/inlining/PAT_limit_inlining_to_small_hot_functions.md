# Limit Inlining to Small, Frequently Called Functions

## Pattern Rule
**IF** you are deciding whether to declare a function inline
**THEN** reserve inline for small, frequently called functions, because inline is only a request and overusing it causes code bloat, harder debugging, and forced client recompiles.

## Do
- Inline trivial, hot functions such as a one-line accessor; start by inlining almost nothing and add it later as a deliberate, measured optimization.
- Keep inline off library functions whose bodies may change, so clients can relink instead of recompiling.

## Don't
- Don't declare a function template inline merely because it lives in a header; template placement and the inlining decision are independent.
- Don't assume constructors and destructors are good inline candidates; compilers inject base-class and member construction and destruction code into them, so they are far larger than they look.

## Checklist
- Is this function small and called often enough to justify inlining?
- Am I inlining a template only because it is defined in a header?
- Could inlining this library function force every client to recompile whenever it changes?

## Notes
inline is a request the compiler may ignore, and it rarely inlines loops, recursion, or virtual calls. The costs are code bloat (worse instruction-cache behavior), debuggers that cannot step into an absent function, and binary fragility: a change to an inline library function forces clients to recompile, not just relink. Constructors and destructors hide generated construction/destruction code, so they inline larger than they appear. Follow the 80-20 rule and inline only the small, hot functions that matter.
