# Return a Reference to *this from Assignment Operators

## Pattern Rule
**IF** you implement a copy assignment operator or a compound assignment such as `+=` or `*=`
**THEN** return a reference to *this, so assignments chain the way they do for built-in types and the standard library.

## Do
- End the operator with `return *this;` and declare its return type a reference to the class.
- Apply the same convention to every assignment form, including operators whose parameter is not the class type.

## Don't
- Don't return void or a copy from an assignment operator; it compiles, but chaining like `a = b = c` breaks and the type stops matching the convention every built-in and standard type follows.

## Checklist
- Does each assignment operator return a reference to *this?
- Does chaining (a = b = c) work on this type?

## Notes
Assignment is right-associative, so `x = y = z = 15` assigns 15 to z, then the updated z to y, then to x — which only works if each assignment yields a reference to its left-hand object. Every built-in type and every standard-library type (string, vector, shared_ptr) follows this, so a type that does not is gratuitously inconsistent. It is only a convention — code that breaks it compiles — but there is rarely a good reason to.
