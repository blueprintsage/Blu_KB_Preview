# Know the Special Member Functions the Compiler Writes for You

## Pattern Rule
**IF** you declare a class without writing its copy constructor, copy assignment operator, destructor, or (when you declare no constructors) default constructor
**THEN** expect the compiler to generate public inline versions on demand, and know the cases where it refuses — so copying and destruction never behave in a way you did not write.

## Do
- Expect a generated copy to duplicate each non-static member memberwise: a string member through its own copy constructor, an int member bit-for-bit.
- Remember the default constructor is generated only when you declare no constructors at all; declaring any constructor suppresses it.
- Know the generated destructor is non-virtual unless a base class already declares a virtual destructor.

## Don't
- Don't assume a copy assignment operator is always generated: the compiler refuses when the class holds a reference member, a const member, or a base whose copy assignment is private.

## Checklist
- Which special members will the compiler generate for this class, and which am I relying on?
- Does a reference or const member here suppress the generated copy assignment?
- Do I actually want memberwise copying, or something different?

## Notes
An empty class is not empty once the compiler adds a default constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor — all public and inline, and only when used. The `NamedObject` example shows the memberwise behavior; the reference-and-const version shows the refusal, because reseating a reference is impossible and const members cannot be assigned. Knowing exactly what is generated (and when it is not) is the prerequisite for the copy-control decisions in the rest of this chapter.
