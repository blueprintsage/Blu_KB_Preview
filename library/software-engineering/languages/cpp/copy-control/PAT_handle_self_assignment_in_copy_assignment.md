# Make Copy Assignment Safe Under Self-Assignment

## Pattern Rule
**IF** you write a copy assignment operator that frees a resource before acquiring the new one
**THEN** make it safe when the source and target are the same object, because aliasing — `a[i] = a[j]`, `*px = *py`, a base reference bound to a derived object — means self-assignment really happens.

## Do
- Order the statements so the new resource is acquired before the old one is freed: remember the original pointer, point to a fresh copy of the source's resource, then delete the original.
- Add an identity test (return early when this equals the source's address) only when you expect self-assignment often enough to justify the branch, or use copy-and-swap.

## Don't
- Don't delete the current resource and then copy from the source; if the source is the same object, you have destroyed the very thing you were about to copy, leaving a pointer to freed memory.

## Checklist
- Called with the same object as source and target, does the object survive intact?
- Is the new resource acquired before the old one is released?
- Is the operator exception-safe, which usually makes it self-assignment-safe too?

## Notes
The classic bug (a `Widget` owning a `Bitmap*`) deletes `pb` and then copies from the source — fatal when they are the same object. The identity test at the top fixes self-assignment but not exception safety; reordering to copy-before-delete fixes both, and copy-and-swap is the idiomatic third option. Aiming for exception safety usually yields self-assignment safety for free, so it is increasingly common to solve the exception problem and let self-assignment fall out.
