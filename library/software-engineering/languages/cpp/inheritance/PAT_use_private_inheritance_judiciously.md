# Use Private Inheritance Only When Composition Cannot Do the Job

## Pattern Rule
**IF** a relationship is is-implemented-in-terms-of
**THEN** model it with composition by default, and use private inheritance only when you must access the other class's protected members or redefine its virtual functions.

## Do
- Default to composition for is-implemented-in-terms-of; it is easier to understand and keeps the borrowed interface out of your class's public face.
- Reach for private inheritance when you must redefine an inherited virtual (a Widget privately inheriting Timer to override onTick) or reach protected members.
- Consider a nested class that publicly inherits the helper (a private WidgetTimer) as a composition-based alternative that also blocks further overriding and cuts compilation dependencies.

## Don't
- Don't use private inheritance where composition works; private inheritance means implementation only, so it buys nothing over a member except when virtuals or protected access are involved.
- Don't mistake private inheritance for is-a; the compiler will not convert a privately-derived object to its base, and all inherited members become private.

## Checklist
- Is this is-implemented-in-terms-of (not is-a)?
- Do I actually need to redefine a virtual or reach protected members — or will composition suffice?
- Would a nested publicly-inheriting helper give the same result with less coupling?

## Notes
Private inheritance means is-implemented-in-terms-of, the same as composition, so composition wins by default. Its narrow justification is redefining inherited virtuals or reaching protected members — the Widget/Timer onTick case. Even then a private nested class that publicly inherits the helper often works and adds the ability to stop derived classes overriding the virtual and to reduce compilation dependencies. One niche bonus: private inheritance enables the empty base optimization, which composition cannot, occasionally mattering to library authors minimizing object size.
