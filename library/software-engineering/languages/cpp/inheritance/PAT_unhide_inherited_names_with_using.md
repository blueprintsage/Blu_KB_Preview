# Unhide Inherited Overloads with using Declarations

## Pattern Rule
**IF** a derived class declares a function whose name matches one that has overloads in the base class
**THEN** restore the hidden base overloads with a `using` declaration (or, under private inheritance, a forwarding function), because a name in a derived scope hides every base overload of that name.

## Do
- Add `using Base::name;` in the derived class for each inherited name you would otherwise hide, so all base overloads stay visible alongside the derived ones.
- Put those using declarations in the same access section they had in the base — public names stay public under public inheritance.
- Under private inheritance, when you want only one specific overload, write a small forwarding function that calls the base version instead of a using declaration.

## Don't
- Don't assume declaring one overload in the derived class keeps the others; name lookup hides all base overloads of that name, even ones with different parameter types and regardless of virtual-ness.
- Don't leave overloads hidden under public inheritance — losing them violates the is-a relationship, since a base call that should work no longer compiles.

## Checklist
- Does a derived declaration share a name with base overloads I still want callable?
- Is there a `using` declaration (or forwarding function) making the base overloads visible?
- Under public inheritance, can every base overload still be called on a derived object?

## Notes
Name hiding is a scope rule, not an inheritance rule: a derived `mf3()` hides `Base::mf3()` and `Base::mf3(double)` alike, just as a local variable hides a global of the same name regardless of type. The default protects against accidentally inheriting overloads from distant bases, but under public inheritance you almost always want them, so a `using` declaration is the fix. Private inheritance is the one case where selectively exposing a single overload — via a forwarding function — is legitimate.
