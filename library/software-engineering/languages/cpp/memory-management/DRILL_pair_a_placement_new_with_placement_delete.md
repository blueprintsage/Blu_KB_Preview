# Pair a Placement new with a Placement delete and Restore Hidden Forms

## Practice Task
Given a class with a logging placement operator new (taking an ostream) but only a normal operator delete, fix the memory leak when the constructor throws, and restore the standard new forms the class new hid.

## Target Skill
Declaring a placement delete matching a placement new, and re-exposing the standard forms.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
- Reproduce the leak: construct an object with the placement new and have its constructor throw; observe that no delete runs.
- Add a placement operator delete taking the same ostream parameter; confirm it now runs on a constructor exception.
- Keep the normal operator delete for ordinary delete on the pointer.
- Re-expose the standard new forms hidden by the class new, using a base class of standard forms and using declarations.

## Success Check
- A throwing constructor after the placement new invokes the matching placement delete, so no memory leaks.
- Plain new and nothrow new still compile for the class.

## Common Failures
- Declaring a placement new without its matching placement delete.
- Forgetting that the class operator new hides the normal and nothrow forms.

## Notes
This drills Item 52: the runtime undoes a failed placement new only via the placement delete with matching extra parameters, and any class operator new hides the standard forms until you bring them back.
