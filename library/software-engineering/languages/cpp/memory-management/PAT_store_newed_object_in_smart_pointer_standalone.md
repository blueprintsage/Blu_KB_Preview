# Store a newed Object in a Smart Pointer in Its Own Statement

## Pattern Rule
**IF** you pass a newly allocated object to a function by wrapping it in a smart pointer
**THEN** create the object and store it in the smart pointer in a separate, standalone statement first, then pass the smart pointer to the function.

## Do
- Put the smart-pointer construction on its own line — a shared pointer `pw` initialized from `new Widget` — then call the function with `pw`.
- Rely on the fact that compilers may not reorder operations across statement boundaries, so the raw pointer cannot be stranded between allocation and capture.

## Don't
- Don't construct the smart pointer from new inside a function-argument list next to another argument that can throw; the compiler may run the new, then evaluate the other argument, and if that throws, the raw pointer leaks before the smart pointer captures it.

## Checklist
- Is each newed object stored in its smart pointer in a statement of its own before being passed on?
- Could any other argument evaluated in the same call throw between the new and the smart-pointer construction?

## Notes
Within a single statement compilers may interleave the steps of `processWidget(std::tr1::shared_ptr(new Widget), priority())`: run the new, call priority, then construct the smart pointer. If priority throws in that window, the raw pointer from new is lost before anything owns it. Splitting the allocation into its own statement removes the window, because compilers get far less freedom to reorder across statements than within one.
