# Implement Traits-Based Compile-Time Dispatch

## Practice Task
Implement an advance(iter, d) that uses iterator arithmetic for random-access iterators and iterative stepping for others, choosing the implementation at compile time.

## Target Skill
Dispatching on a type's traits via overloaded worker functions instead of a runtime type test.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
- Read the iterator's category from iterator_traits (its iterator_category), which is available during compilation.
- Write overloaded doAdvance workers, one per iterator category tag, each using only the operations valid for that category (+= for random access, stepping for bidirectional and input).
- Write the master advance that constructs the category tag from the traits and passes it, letting overload resolution pick the worker.
- Confirm a bidirectional iterator compiles because its worker never uses +=.

## Success Check
- The random-access path uses += and the others step, with the choice made during compilation.
- Calling advance on a bidirectional iterator compiles, unlike a runtime typeid version.

## Common Failures
- Branching at runtime with typeid, which both wastes runtime and forces the invalid += branch to compile.
- Forgetting that the input-iterator worker also serves forward iterators through tag inheritance.

## Notes
This drills Items 47 and 48: the traits-plus-overloading dispatch is template metaprogramming — a compile-time if/else that keeps each type's code in a function using only that type's valid operations.
