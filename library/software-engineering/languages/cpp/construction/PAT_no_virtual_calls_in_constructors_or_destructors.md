# Don't Call Virtual Functions During Construction or Destruction

## Pattern Rule
**IF** you are in a constructor or destructor and want behavior that varies with the object's dynamic type
**THEN** do not obtain it by calling a virtual function — during base construction and destruction the call resolves to the base version, never the derived override.

## Do
- Pass type-specific data upward: have each derived constructor compute what the base needs and hand it to the base constructor, which then calls a non-virtual function.
- Build that information in a private static helper on the derived class, so it cannot touch the object's not-yet-initialized members.

## Don't
- Don't call a virtual function — directly, or through a non-virtual helper like an `init` routine — from a constructor or destructor expecting the derived version; during base construction the object is of the base type and the base version runs.

## Checklist
- Does any constructor or destructor call a virtual function, directly or via a helper it invokes?
- When a base needs type-specific data, is it passed up from the derived constructor rather than fetched through a virtual call?

## Notes
Base parts are constructed before derived parts, so during the base constructor the derived members do not yet exist; C++ therefore treats the object as the base type — virtual dispatch, dynamic_cast, and typeid all resolve to the base. The `Transaction`/`logTransaction` example shows the trap, and the `init`-helper version shows why it is insidious: it compiles and links. The fix is to feed the base what it needs from the derived constructor (often via a static helper such as `createLogString`) and call a non-virtual function.
