# Don't Return Handles to Object Internals

## Pattern Rule
**IF** a member function would hand back a reference, pointer, or iterator to the object's internal data
**THEN** avoid it — a returned handle breaks encapsulation, lets a const function's caller modify internals, and can dangle when a temporary owner is destroyed.

## Do
- Return by value, or return a const handle only when you deliberately intend read-only access to something the object genuinely exposes.
- Treat private and protected member functions as internals too — never return a pointer to a less-accessible member function.

## Don't
- Don't return a non-const reference, pointer, or iterator to a data member; a member is only as encapsulated as the most accessible function returning a handle to it, so this makes it effectively public.
- Don't return a handle from a function whose result may outlive the object — a handle into a temporary returned by value dangles at the end of the statement.

## Checklist
- Does this function return a reference, pointer, or iterator into the object's internals?
- Could that handle let a caller modify a const object, or outlive the object and dangle?
- If access is intended, is it limited to read-only through a const handle?

## Notes
`Rectangle::upperLeft`/`lowerRight` returning non-const references to internal points let a caller mutate a const rectangle — a const member function handing out a writable handle. Making the return const fixes the modification hole but not the dangling one: `boundingBox(*pgo).upperLeft()` takes a handle into a temporary that dies at the statement's end. References, pointers, and iterators are all handles; returning any of them risks outliving the object. operator[] on string and vector is the rare, deliberate exception.
