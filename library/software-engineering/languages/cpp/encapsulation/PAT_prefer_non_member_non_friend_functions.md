# Prefer Non-member Non-friend Functions to Member Functions

## Pattern Rule
**IF** a function can be written using only a class's public interface
**THEN** make it a non-member non-friend function rather than a member, because that increases encapsulation, packaging flexibility, and extensibility.

## Do
- Place such convenience functions in the same namespace as the class, spread across headers by topic, so clients depend only on the parts they use and can add their own.
- Count access: a non-member non-friend cannot touch private members, so it does not enlarge the set of functions that can — which is exactly what keeps the data encapsulated.

## Don't
- Don't reach for friend when a function should not be a member; a friend has the same private access as a member and the same encapsulation cost — the alternative to a member is a non-member, not a friend.

## Checklist
- Can this function do its job through the public interface alone, and if so is it a non-member?
- Is it in the class's namespace, grouped by topic across headers?
- Am I about to make it a friend when a plain non-member would do?

## Notes
Encapsulation is measured by how few functions can reach the private data; a member (or friend) adds to that count, a non-member non-friend does not — so `clearBrowser` encapsulates the `WebBrowser` better than a `clearEverything` member. Namespaces, unlike classes, span multiple headers, so convenience functions can be partitioned by topic (mirroring how the standard library splits its headers), letting clients depend only on what they use and extend the set freely.
