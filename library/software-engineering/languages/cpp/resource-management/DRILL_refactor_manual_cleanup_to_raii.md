# Refactor Manual Resource Cleanup into an RAII Object

## Practice Task
Take a function that calls a factory such as `createInvestment`, uses the returned raw pointer, and deletes it at the end, and make it leak-proof with RAII.

## Target Skill
Handing an acquired resource to a manager whose destructor releases it, on every exit path.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
- Mark each path — early return, loop break, thrown exception — where the manual delete would be skipped.
- Wrap the returned pointer in a smart pointer at the point of acquisition.
- Delete the manual delete statement and confirm the destructor releases on every path.
- Note why an array allocation would need a different manager than a single-object smart pointer.

## Success Check
- No manual delete remains, and the resource is freed on every exit, including when an exception is thrown.
- The resource is handed to its manager in the same statement that acquires it.

## Common Failures
- Storing the raw pointer in a variable and forgetting to wrap it before the risky code.
- Using a single-object smart pointer for an array allocation, so the wrong delete form runs.

## Notes
This drills Item 13: the leak is not a coding slip but a structural weakness of manual cleanup, which RAII removes by tying release to destruction.
