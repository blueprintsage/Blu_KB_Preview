# Precede Nested Dependent Type Names with typename

## Pattern Rule
**IF** you refer to a nested dependent type name inside a template — a type nested in something that depends on a template parameter, such as C::const_iterator
**THEN** precede it with the keyword typename, because the compiler otherwise assumes a nested dependent name is not a type.

## Do
- Write typename before the nested dependent type when declaring a variable of it, so the parser reads it as a type rather than a value.
- Pair it with typedef for long traits names (typedef typename ... value_type value_type;) so you write the full name only once.

## Don't
- Don't put typename on a non-dependent name or on the template parameter itself (the C in a const C& parameter); typename is only for nested dependent type names.
- Don't use typename in a base class list or a member initialization list, even for a nested dependent type name — it is disallowed in those two positions.

## Checklist
- Is this a type nested inside something dependent on a template parameter, and is it preceded by typename?
- Am I wrongly adding typename to a non-dependent name or in a base-class-list or init-list position?
- Have I used typedef typename to avoid repeating a long nested dependent type name?

## Notes
Until the template parameter is known, the parser cannot tell whether C::const_iterator names a type or a static member being multiplied, so C++ assumes not-a-type by default; typename overrides that. The rule has one irksome exception — a base class list and a member initialization list forbid typename on the same names that otherwise require it. The typedef typename juxtaposition looks odd but follows directly from the rule.
