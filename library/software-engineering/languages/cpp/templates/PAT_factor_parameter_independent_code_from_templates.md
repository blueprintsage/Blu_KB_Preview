# Factor Parameter-Independent Code Out of Templates

## Pattern Rule
**IF** a template instantiates code that does not actually depend on all of its parameters (such as a non-type size parameter)
**THEN** factor that code into a less-parameterized place — a base class templatized only on the varying type, or function parameters and data members instead of non-type parameters — to avoid code bloat from repeated instantiations.

## Do
- Move size-independent logic into a base class templatized only on the element type, and have each sized derived class make inline calls into it (SquareMatrix delegating to SquareMatrixBase).
- Replace a non-type template parameter with a function parameter or a data member so one function body serves many sizes.
- Cut type-parameter bloat by having strongly-typed instantiations share one underlying implementation — pointer templates delegating to a void-pointer version.

## Don't
- Don't leave code that differs only by a constant inside the template; each instantiation duplicates it, as a 5-by-5 and a 10-by-10 invert do.
- Don't inline the shared base function, or you reinstate the duplication you just factored out.

## Checklist
- Does any code in this template not depend on all of its parameters?
- Can a non-type parameter become a function parameter or a data member?
- Is the shared implementation non-inline and reused across instantiations?

## Notes
Template replication is implicit: one source copy, but many instantiated bodies. The SquareMatrix invert example bloats because size is a non-type parameter, so each size gets its own copy; moving invert into a base templatized only on the element type (reached by private inheritance) shares one body. Trade-offs are real — the size-specific version can optimize a compile-time constant the shared version cannot, and a stored data pointer adds size — so measure before deciding.
