# Fix Access to a Name in a Templatized Base Class

## Practice Task
Given a derived class template (a LoggingMsgSender) that calls an inherited function (sendClear) from its base class template (MsgSender) and won't compile, make it compile three different ways.

## Target Skill
Turning on the compiler's search of a templatized base class for an inherited name.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
- Reproduce the failure: an unqualified call to the inherited function does not compile, because the compiler won't search the templatized base.
- Fix it with a this-> prefix on the call.
- Fix it again with a using declaration bringing the base name into the derived scope.
- Fix it a third time with explicit base-class qualification, and note why that is worst when the function is virtual.

## Success Check
- Each of the three forms compiles for a base specialization that provides the name.
- A base specialization that omits the name still fails to compile, at instantiation, as expected.

## Common Failures
- Leaving the call unqualified and expecting inheritance to just work across the template boundary.
- Using explicit qualification on a virtual function and silently disabling virtual dispatch.

## Notes
This drills Item 43: all three fixes promise the name is inherited; C++ diagnoses an unfounded promise later, when the template is instantiated with a base specialization that lacks it.
