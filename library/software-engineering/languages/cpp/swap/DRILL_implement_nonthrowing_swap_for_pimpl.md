# Implement an Efficient Non-throwing swap for a Pimpl Type

## Practice Task
Given a `Widget` that holds a pointer to a `WidgetImpl` (the pimpl idiom), give it an efficient, non-throwing swap wired up correctly.

## Target Skill
Providing a member swap, a namespace non-member swap, and a std::swap specialization, and calling swap correctly.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
- Add a public member swap that exchanges the two internal pointers and cannot throw.
- Add a non-member swap in Widget's namespace that calls the member.
- For this non-template class, totally specialize std::swap to call the member.
- Write a client that does `using std::swap;` then calls swap unqualified, and confirm the Widget-specific version is chosen.

## Success Check
- Swapping two Widgets exchanges only the internal pointers, not the underlying data.
- Both an unqualified swap and a qualified std::swap call reach the fast version.

## Common Failures
- Adding an overload or a partial specialization of swap inside namespace std.
- Qualifying the call as std::swap and losing argument-dependent lookup to the type-specific version.

## Notes
This drills Item 25: the three-part setup plus the unqualified-call convention is what makes the fast, non-throwing swap reachable in every context, including code that wrongly qualifies the call.
