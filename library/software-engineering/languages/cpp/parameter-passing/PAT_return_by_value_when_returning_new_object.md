# Return by Value When You Must Return a New Object

## Pattern Rule
**IF** a function must produce a brand-new object that did not exist before the call, such as operator*
**THEN** return it by value; never return a reference or pointer to a local object, a heap object, or a shared function-static.

## Do
- Return the new object by value and let the compiler's return-value optimization remove the copy where it can.
- Construct the result directly in the return statement, giving that optimization the best chance to apply.

## Don't
- Don't return a reference or pointer to a local object — it is destroyed when the function exits, leaving a dangling reference.
- Don't return a reference to a heap object — callers cannot delete what they cannot reach through the reference, so it leaks.
- Don't return a reference to a function-static — every call shares one object, making comparisons of two results always equal.

## Checklist
- Does this function create a new object that no existing reference could already name?
- Am I about to return a reference or pointer to a local, heap, or static object?
- Have I returned by value and left the efficiency to the compiler?

## Notes
Chasing pass-by-reference too far leads to returning references to objects that do not exist. For operator*, the local version dangles, the heap version leaks (no one can reach the pointer to delete it), and the single-static version makes `(a*b) == (c*d)` always true because both sides name the same static. The correct answer is to return a new object by value; return-value optimization often erases the cost, so correctness need not be sacrificed for speed.
