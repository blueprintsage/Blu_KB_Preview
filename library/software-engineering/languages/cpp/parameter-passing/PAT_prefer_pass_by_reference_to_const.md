# Prefer Pass-by-Reference-to-const to Pass-by-Value

## Pattern Rule
**IF** a function parameter is of a user-defined type
**THEN** pass it by reference-to-const, which skips the copy-constructor and destructor calls that pass-by-value incurs and avoids slicing a derived argument down to its base.

## Do
- Declare the parameter as a reference to const, so no new object is constructed and the caller is still protected from modification.
- Pass built-in types, and STL iterators and function objects, by value instead — they are cheap to copy and designed for it.

## Don't
- Don't assume a small user-defined type is cheap by value; a small object can hold a pointer to a lot of data, its copy constructor can be costly, and its size can grow in a later release.
- Don't pass a derived object by value through a base-type parameter — the base copy constructor slices off the derived part and later virtual calls resolve to the base.

## Checklist
- Is this a user-defined-type parameter passed by reference-to-const rather than by value?
- Could passing by value slice a derived argument here?
- Is this one of the exceptions — built-in, iterator, function object — where by-value is right?

## Notes
Passing a `Student` by value fired one Student, one Person, and four string copy constructors (and as many destructors); reference-to-const fires none. It also prevents slicing: a `WindowWithScrollBars` passed by value into a `Window` parameter loses its derived behavior and calls the base display(). The exceptions — built-ins, STL iterators, and function objects — are exactly the sublanguages where by-value is the convention (Item 1).
