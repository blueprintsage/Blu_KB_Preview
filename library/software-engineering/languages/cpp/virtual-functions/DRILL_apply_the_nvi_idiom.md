# Apply the Non-Virtual Interface Idiom

## Practice Task
Given a class with a public virtual `healthValue`, convert it to the non-virtual interface idiom so the base controls the context around the call.

## Target Skill
Turning a public virtual into a public non-virtual wrapper around a non-public virtual.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
- Make `healthValue` a public non-virtual function and add a private virtual `doHealthValue` that does the real work.
- Have the wrapper call the private virtual, adding before-work (lock a mutex, check invariants and preconditions) and after-work (unlock, verify postconditions).
- Override `doHealthValue` in a derived class and confirm the wrapper's context still runs around it.
- Note when the virtual must be protected instead of private (when overrides call the base version).

## Success Check
- Clients call only the non-virtual wrapper; derived classes customize only the private virtual.
- The setup/teardown context runs on every call regardless of the override.

## Common Failures
- Leaving the virtual public, so clients bypass the wrapper's context.
- Assuming a private virtual cannot be overridden — it can; only calling it is restricted.

## Notes
This drills Item 35's NVI idiom (a Template Method form): derived classes control how via the private virtual, the base controls when via the wrapper.
