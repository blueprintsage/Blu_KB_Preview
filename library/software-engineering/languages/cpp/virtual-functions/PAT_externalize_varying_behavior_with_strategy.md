# Externalize Varying Behavior with the Strategy Pattern

## Pattern Rule
**IF** a behavior varies and need not depend on an object's type at all
**THEN** move it out of the class as a Strategy — a function pointer, a tr1::function object, or a separate hierarchy the object holds — instead of a member virtual function.

## Do
- Hold a callable the object calls to do the work (a health calculator passed to the constructor), so different instances of one type can behave differently and the behavior can change at runtime.
- Prefer a tr1::function member over a bare function pointer: it accepts any compatible callable — a free function, a function object, or a bound member function — and any return type convertible to what you need.
- Use a separate strategy hierarchy when you want the classic Strategy shape and the ability to extend algorithms by deriving new strategy classes.

## Don't
- Don't reach for Strategy when the behavior genuinely needs the object's private data; a non-member strategy has no special access, so you would have to weaken encapsulation with friends or accessors.
- Don't assume the strategy must be a plain function returning an exact type; that rigidity is exactly what a tr1::function member removes.

## Checklist
- Does this behavior really depend on the object's type, or can it be supplied from outside?
- Do I need per-instance or runtime-swappable behavior (Strategy) rather than per-type (virtual)?
- Does the strategy need private data — and if so, is weakening encapsulation worth it?

## Notes
Strategy externalizes what a virtual function keeps inside the hierarchy. A function-pointer member already gives per-object, runtime-swappable behavior; a tr1::function member generalizes it to any compatible callable (free function, functor, or a member bound with tr1::bind), even with a convertible return type. A separate strategy hierarchy is the textbook form. The one cost is access: an external strategy cannot see private members, so pick it only when the calculation needs no private state or the encapsulation trade is acceptable.
