# Match a Function's Virtual-ness to What Derived Classes Must Inherit

## Pattern Rule
**IF** you declare a member function in a base class
**THEN** choose pure virtual, simple virtual, or non-virtual to say exactly what derived classes inherit — interface only, interface plus an overridable default, or interface plus a mandatory implementation.

## Do
- Declare a pure virtual function when derived classes must supply their own implementation and the base has no sensible default (Shape::draw).
- Declare a simple virtual function when there is a reasonable default derived classes may override (Shape::error).
- Declare a non-virtual function when the behavior is an invariant over specialization that no derived class should change (Shape::objectID).

## Don't
- Don't give a simple virtual both an interface and a silently-inherited default when forgetting to override is dangerous; sever them — make it pure virtual and offer the default as a separate protected `defaultFly`, or as a definition of the pure virtual that derived classes call explicitly — so a new ModelC cannot inherit the wrong behavior by accident.
- Don't reflexively make everything non-virtual (no room to specialize) or everything virtual (no invariants); each extreme is a common beginner mistake.

## Checklist
- For each base function, have I decided: interface only, interface plus default, or interface plus mandatory implementation?
- Where a default exists, must derived classes opt in explicitly rather than inherit it silently?
- Are functions that represent an invariant over specialization non-virtual, and customization points virtual?

## Notes
Public inheritance always inherits the interface; the declaration kind decides what else. The Airplane fly() trap is the key lesson: a simple virtual with a default let ModelC silently fly like a ModelA. Severing interface from default — pure virtual `fly` plus protected `defaultFly`, or a defined pure virtual called explicitly — forces each derived class to opt in. Choosing deliberately among pure/simple/non-virtual is how you state precisely what you want inherited.
