# Replace Non-local static Objects with Function-Local statics

## Pattern Rule
**IF** one non-local static object's initialization uses another non-local static defined in a different translation unit
**THEN** move each object into its own function that returns a reference to a function-local static, and have clients call the functions — because the relative initialization order of non-local statics across translation units is undefined.

## Do
- Convert `extern FileSystem tfs;` into `FileSystem& tfs() { static FileSystem fs; return fs; }` and have callers use `tfs()` instead of `tfs`.
- Lean on C++'s guarantee that a function-local static is initialized the first time control reaches its definition, so the referenced object always exists by the time it is used.

## Don't
- Don't leave a cross-translation-unit static dependency to chance: a `tempDir` whose constructor calls `tfs.numDisks()` may run before `tfs` is constructed, which is undefined and varies by platform.
- Don't assume this is thread-safe — the first-use initialization of a local static can race, so trigger each function during single-threaded startup.

## Checklist
- Does any non-local static depend on another defined in a different translation unit?
- Is each such object now reached through a function returning a local-static reference?
- Are those functions invoked during single-threaded startup to head off initialization races?

## Notes
This is the "static initialization order fiasco": the standard leaves the cross-translation-unit ordering undefined, and finding a correct order is unsolvable in general once implicit template instantiations enter. The fix converts non-local statics into local statics, whose initialization order C++ *does* pin down — first use. Aficionados will recognize this as the reference-returning core of the Singleton pattern. The one caveat is threading: local-static first-use initialization can race, so warm the functions up on a single thread at startup.
