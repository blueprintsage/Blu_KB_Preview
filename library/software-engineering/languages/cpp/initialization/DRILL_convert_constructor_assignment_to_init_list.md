# Convert Constructor Body Assignments to an Initializer List

## Practice Task
Start from an `ABEntry` constructor whose body assigns `theName`, `theAddress`, `thePhones`, and `numTimesConsulted`, and rewrite it to initialize those members properly.

## Target Skill
Moving member setup out of the constructor body and into the initialization list, in declaration order, including members that must be initialized there.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
- Move each member from a body assignment into the member initialization list.
- Order the list to match the order the members are declared in the class.
- Add a `const` or reference member to the class and confirm it now compiles only when initialized through the list.
- Compare the two versions and note where the body-assignment form did redundant work.

## Success Check
- Class-type members are copy-constructed once rather than default-constructed and then assigned.
- The list order matches the declaration order.
- The `const`/reference member compiles only via the list, not by body assignment.

## Common Failures
- Leaving a built-in member such as `numTimesConsulted` off the list and then reading it while uninitialized.
- Assuming the order written in the list, rather than the declaration order, drives initialization.

## Notes
This makes the assignment-versus-initialization distinction concrete: the body-assignment version default-constructs the string and list members before overwriting them, work the initialization list skips. The added `const`/reference member shows the case where the list is not merely better but mandatory.
