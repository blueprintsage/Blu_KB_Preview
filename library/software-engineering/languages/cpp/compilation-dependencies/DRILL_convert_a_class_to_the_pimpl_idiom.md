# Convert a Class to the Pimpl Idiom

## Practice Task
Given a `Person` class whose header includes date.h and address.h and stores those members directly, convert it to a Handle class using the pimpl idiom.

## Target Skill
Replacing dependencies on definitions with dependencies on declarations by hiding data behind an implementation pointer.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
- Move the data members into a forward-declared `PersonImpl` class defined in a separate file.
- Give `Person` a single smart pointer to `PersonImpl` and forward each member function to it.
- Replace definition includes in the header with forward declarations where possible, and include declaration-only headers for the types used in the interface.
- Confirm that changing `PersonImpl` no longer forces clients of `Person` to recompile.

## Success Check
- `Person`'s header depends on declarations, not definitions, of its implementation types.
- A change to the implementation requires clients only to relink, not recompile.

## Common Failures
- Leaving definition includes in the header that reintroduce the dependency.
- Forward-declaring a standard-library type such as string instead of including its header.

## Notes
This drills Item 31: the pimpl pointer plus forward declarations move the implementation types out of the header, so client code depends only on the interface.
