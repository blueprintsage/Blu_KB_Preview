# Make a Hidden Side Effect Obvious or Remove It

## Practice Task
Take a getter-like function that secretly modifies state, decide whether the side effect is needed, and either remove it or rename to surface it — then trace the fix through its callers.

## Target Skill
Finding side effects that a function's name hides and resolving them by deletion or honest naming.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
1. Start from a read-style function that also mutates state — a `getPixel` that calls `canvas.redraw()` before returning a color.
2. List the ways the hidden effect can bite: an expensive loop (a screenshot calling it per pixel), a broken assumption (a redaction that assumes no redraw), and a concurrency hazard across threads.
3. Ask whether the side effect is actually necessary; if not, remove it and confirm the problems disappear.
4. If it is necessary, rename the function to name the effect (`redrawAndGetPixel`) and propagate honest names to callers that inherit it (`redrawAndCaptureScreenshot`).
5. Re-examine each caller and confirm the new name would make them reconsider the expensive loop, the broken assumption, and the threading risk.

## Success Check
- The function either no longer causes the side effect or names it unmistakably.
- Callers that inherit the effect also name it, so no reader is misled.
- Each of the three original failure modes is visibly addressed.

## Common Failures
- Renaming the leaf function but leaving inheriting callers with innocent-looking names.
- Keeping an unnecessary side effect and only documenting it in a comment instead of removing it.

## Notes
This drills Long's `getPixel`/`captureScreenshot` cascade, where one hidden redraw causes a 47-minute freeze, a privacy leak, and a threading bug. The reflex it builds is to treat a getter that mutates as a defect and to fix it at the name, so the caller's mental model can no longer be wrong.
