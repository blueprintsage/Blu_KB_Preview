# Avoid Returning Magic Values

## Pattern Rule
**IF** a function may be unable to produce a real value — the input is empty, a field is absent, the result is uncalculable
**THEN** signal that explicitly with a nullable or optional return, or an error, rather than returning a magic value that fits the normal return type but carries a special meaning.

## Do
- Make absence part of the unmistakable contract: change a `getAge()` that returns `-1` for a missing age into one that returns `Int?`, so callers get a compiler error until they handle the null.
- Watch for magic values that arise accidentally, not just deliberately: a `minValue()` that seeds with `Int.MAX_VALUE` silently returns it for an empty list, which crowns an unplayed game level "easiest" in a maximin.
- Accept the small caller burden of a null check as far cheaper than the bug it prevents, and use an error-signaling technique instead when the caller needs to know why the value is absent.

## Don't
- Don't hide absence inside a non-nullable return type; a caller summing `getAge()` values produces a plausible-but-wrong mean because `-1`s slip into the total.
- Don't assume a magic value like `Int.MAX_VALUE` is a safe default — it is language-specific, corrupts databases and cross-language clients, and breaks any comparison that treats it as a real result.

## Checklist
- Can this function fail to produce a real value, and does the return type say so?
- Could any returned sentinel be mistaken for a legitimate normal result?
- Does an empty or edge-case input silently yield an in-band special value?

## Notes
This is the avoid-surprises home for magic values that chapter 4 deferred here. The `getMeanAge` bug is the anchor: a `-1`-for-absent age documented only in small print produces a wrong statistic that unit tests miss, because the caller never knew to test the absent case. A nullable return forces the caller to confront absence at compile time, at the cost of a handled null — a trade the chapter argues is almost always worth it, escalating to an error type when the reason for absence matters.
