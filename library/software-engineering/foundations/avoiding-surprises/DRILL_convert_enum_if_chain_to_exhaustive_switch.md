# Convert an Enum If-Chain to an Exhaustive Switch With a Test

## Practice Task
Take code that handles an enum with an if-statement, convert it to handle every value explicitly and fail loudly on an unhandled one, then prove a new value is caught.

## Target Skill
Making enum handling robust to future values with an exhaustive switch and an all-values test.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
1. Start from a function that special-cases one enum value and implicitly treats the rest — for example returning false for `COMPANY_WILL_GO_BUST` and true otherwise.
2. Rewrite it as a switch with an explicit case for every current value, and a throw of an unchecked exception placed after the switch, not in a default case.
3. Add a unit test that calls the function once for every value returned by the enum's values list.
4. Add a new value to the enum and confirm the test fails (and, in a language that warns on non-exhaustive switches, that the compiler warns) rather than the code silently mishandling it.
5. Handle the new value explicitly and confirm the test passes again, adding a case that asserts its intended result.

## Success Check
- Every existing enum value has an explicit branch.
- Adding a value triggers a failing test or a compiler warning, never silent behavior.
- The catch-all is a throw after the switch, preserving the exhaustiveness warning.

## Common Failures
- Using a value-returning default case, which silently absorbs new values.
- Putting the throw inside a default case, which makes the compiler think the switch is exhaustive and suppresses its warning.

## Notes
This drills the `PredictedOutcome` example, whose `WORLD_WILL_END` value would slip through an if-chain as "safe." The point is defense in depth: the exhaustive switch plus an all-values test plus, where available, the compiler's warning together guarantee that a future enum value cannot be handled by accident.
