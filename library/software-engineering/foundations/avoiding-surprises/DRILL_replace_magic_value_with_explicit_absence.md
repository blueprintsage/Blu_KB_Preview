# Replace a Magic Return Value With Explicit Absence

## Practice Task
Take a function that returns a magic value for an absent or uncalculable result, convert it to signal absence explicitly, and watch a caller bug surface.

## Target Skill
Spotting in-band magic values and replacing them with a nullable, optional, or error signal.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
1. Start from a function that returns a sentinel — a `getAge()` returning `-1` for a missing age, or a `minValue()` returning `Int.MAX_VALUE` for an empty list.
2. Write a caller that assumes a real value always comes back — sum ages into a mean, or pick the level with the highest minimum score.
3. Trace what the caller does when the magic value flows through, and name the resulting bug (a wrong mean, an unplayed level ranked easiest).
4. Change the function's return type to nullable or optional (or an error type if the reason matters) so absence is in the contract.
5. Fix the now-failing caller so it compiles, handling the absent case explicitly.

## Success Check
- The function's return type reveals that no value may be available.
- The original caller no longer compiles until it handles absence.
- The corrected caller produces the right answer for the empty or absent case.

## Common Failures
- Swapping one magic value for another (returning `0` or an empty list) instead of making absence explicit.
- Making the return nullable but casting away the null in the caller without really handling it.

## Notes
This drills Long's `getMeanAge` and maximin examples, whose point is that the magic value produces a plausible wrong answer that tests miss. The habit is to distrust any return type that has no room to say "no value," and to let the compiler force every caller to face absence.
