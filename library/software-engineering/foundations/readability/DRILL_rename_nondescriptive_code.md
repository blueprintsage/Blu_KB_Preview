# Rename Nondescriptive Code and Drop the Redundant Comments

## Practice Task
Take a snippet with single-letter names propped up by comments, rename everything descriptively, and delete the comments the names made unnecessary.

## Target Skill
Turning cryptic, comment-dependent code into self-explanatory code through naming.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
1. Start from code with opaque names — a `class T` holding `pns` and `s`, with a function `f(n)` and a free function `s(ts, n)` — and comments explaining each.
2. Read it cold and note every place you had to consult a comment or the class body to understand a name.
3. Rename each class, function, variable, and parameter for the concept it represents (team, player names, score, contains-player, team-score-for-player).
4. Remove each comment that now merely restates a name, keeping only any that document genuine usage.
5. Re-read a call site in isolation and confirm it is clear without opening the class.

## Success Check
- Every name states what the thing is or does without a comment.
- A call like `team.containsPlayer(playerName)` reads clearly on its own.
- Only comments carrying real information (not name-restatements) remain.

## Common Failures
- Renaming but leaving the now-redundant comments, keeping the clutter and the sync burden.
- Half-descriptive names that still need a comment to be understood.

## Notes
This is Long's `T`-to-`Team` transformation as practice. The habit it builds is to reach for a better name before reaching for a comment, and to delete comments that a good name has made redundant so the code carries its own explanation.
