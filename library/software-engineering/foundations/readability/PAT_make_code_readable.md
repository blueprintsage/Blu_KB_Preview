# Write Code That Reads Like a Well-Structured Recipe

## Pattern Rule
**IF** another engineer — or future you — will need to read this code to review, debug, or extend it
**THEN** structure it so a reader can quickly answer what it does, how it does it, what inputs or state it needs, and what it produces, the way a good recipe has a title, ordered steps, named ingredients, and information placed where it is used.

## Do
- Give the code an up-front "title" through clear naming and entry points, so a reader learns what it is about without reading the whole thing.
- Present logic as discrete steps or subproblems instead of one undifferentiated wall.
- Name things for their role — "the bowl with melted butter and chocolate," not "A."
- Keep related information together: put a quantity next to its ingredient, and state a precondition (preheat the oven) where it matters, not stranded at the end.

## Don't
- Don't force readers to decipher vague single-letter labels or reconstruct meaning from an unstructured block of text.
- Don't separate a critical instruction from where it is needed, leaving it discovered too late to act on.

## Checklist
- Can a skim-reader state the subject, the result, and the required inputs without decoding?
- Is every vague label replaced by a name describing the thing's role?
- Does each precondition and quantity sit where it is used?

## Notes

Long demonstrates poor readability with a brownie recipe rewritten as one wall of text: no title, vague labels ("A," "B," "C"), unstructured steps, and the oven-preheat instruction buried at the end. He maps each defect to a code equivalent — a reader struggles to see what the code does, how, what it needs, and what it returns. This is the "readable" pillar's foundation; chapter 5 specializes it into descriptive names, comment use, nesting depth, and named arguments. The paired drill runs the recipe rewrite as practice.

Variant `v_cognition_design_patterns_as_chunks` (The Programmer's Brain, Chapter 2) adds a pattern-literacy route: when a fitting design pattern is familiar to the maintainer or explicitly identified, its participants can be processed as one known structure rather than rediscovered line by line. Use it only when the pattern fits and the audience can recognize it; an unfamiliar or gratuitous pattern adds indirection instead of reducing cognitive load.

Variant `v_cognition_semantic_beacons` (The Programmer's Brain, Chapter 2) adds a signaling route. Meaningful names and operators are simple beacons, while combinations such as paired left/right fields or a complete loop header become compound beacons that reveal a data structure or operation. Use these signals to support a correct high-level hypothesis, but do not add redundant or misleading cues merely to make code look explanatory.
