# Flatten Deeply Nested Logic With Early Returns and Extraction

## Practice Task
Take a function with several levels of nested if-statements and rewrite it flat, extracting a sub-function where a plain early return would skip needed logic.

## Target Skill
Flattening nested control flow and recognizing when nesting means a function does too much.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
1. Start from a function with three or more levels of nested if-else — for example one finding a vehicle owner's address through scrapyard, showroom, and buyer branches.
2. Where every branch ends in a return, rewrite each as an early-return guard clause so the remaining logic is not indented under an else.
3. Take a second function that both computes a value and acts on it (find the address, then send a letter), and confirm a naive early return would wrongly skip the action.
4. Extract the computing part into its own function, then flatten that function with early returns while the outer function calls it and handles the action.
5. Re-read both and confirm the nesting is gone and each function does one clear job.

## Success Check
- The address-finding function reads as a flat sequence of guard clauses.
- The do-too-much function is split so flattening did not skip the letter-sending.
- No branch is indented under an else that a return could replace.

## Common Failures
- Early-returning out of a function whose branches must fall through to shared later logic, skipping it.
- Flattening the syntax but leaving a function that still does two jobs.

## Notes
This drills Long's paired refactors: the pure address-finder flattens directly with guard clauses, while the address-plus-letter function must be split first because an early return would skip the send. The transferable reflex is to try guard clauses, and when they do not fit, read that as a sign to extract a sub-function.
