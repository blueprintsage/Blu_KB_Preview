# Harden a Code Contract From Small Print to Enforcement

## Objective
Take a piece of code whose contract leans on small print and move each term to the strongest available enforcement, so misuse becomes impossible where it can and loudly detectable where it cannot.

## Steps / Flow
1. **Surface the contract.** Write out the preconditions, postconditions, and invariants the code actually imposes, including the ones currently hidden in comments or implied by a required call order.
2. **Label each term by channel.** Mark each as unmistakable (name, parameter type, return type, checked exception) or small print (comment, external doc, unchecked exception), and note which small-print terms cause silent bugs if ignored.
3. **Eliminate invalid states first.** For each small-print term that guards against a bad state, try to make that state unrepresentable — a static factory returning only valid instances, a private constructor, private mutators, no exposed mutable state — so the misuse cannot compile.
4. **Enforce the irreducible remainder with loud checks.** For terms that cannot be made compile-time impossible, add precondition and postcondition checks that throw an obvious, unmissable failure when violated.
5. **Consider assertions for the dev/test tier.** Where a check would be too costly in production or availability outweighs catching the breach in the wild, use assertions that fire in development and testing, understanding they are normally compiled out of release.
6. **Document only what is left, and re-read.** Write clear documentation for any genuinely unavoidable small print, then re-read the contract to confirm the must-know terms now live in unmistakable channels and nothing critical rides on a comment alone.

## Notes
This generalizes the `UserSettings` progression: from a class with loads of small print (ordered `loadSettings()`/`init()`, overloaded null) to one made impossible to misuse via a factory and private setup, with checks and assertions shown as the runtime fallbacks. The ordering is the point — prefer compile-time impossibility, fall back to loud runtime checks, use assertions where the tradeoff fits, and document last. Steps 3's immutability techniques are developed in chapter 7 and step 4's fail-fast behavior in chapter 4; here they combine into a single hardening pass applied when a contract relies too heavily on callers reading the small print.
