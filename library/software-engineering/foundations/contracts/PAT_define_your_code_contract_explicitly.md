# Identify Your Code's Contract Explicitly

## Pattern Rule
**IF** you are writing a function or class that takes inputs, returns values, or changes state
**THEN** recognize you have created a contract and spell out its three kinds of terms — preconditions, postconditions, and invariants — so that nothing a caller must know is left implicit or surprising.

## Do
- Name the preconditions: what must be true before the code runs — required inputs and the state the system must already be in.
- Name the postconditions: what will be true after — values returned and the new state the system is left in.
- Name the invariants: what must be unchanged between before and after the call.

## Don't
- Don't assume "I'm not programming by contract" means there is no contract — any function with parameters, a return value, or a side effect already imposes obligations and expectations.
- Don't leave contract terms in your head; problems arise precisely when a caller is unaware of some or all of the terms.

## Checklist
- Have you stated what a caller must set up or supply before calling (preconditions)?
- Have you stated what they get back and what state results (postconditions)?
- Have you named what must stay unchanged (invariants)?

## Notes
Long draws on the design-by-contract idea: interactions between pieces of code are a contract where the caller meets obligations and the callee delivers a result, with nothing left unclear. The value for everyday coding is the habit of making the three term-types conscious, because the failures come from unstated terms. Making the contract explicit is the setup for the next decision — which terms to make unmistakable versus leave as small print, and how to enforce them.
