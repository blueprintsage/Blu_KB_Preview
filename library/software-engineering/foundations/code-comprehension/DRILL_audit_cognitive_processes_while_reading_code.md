# Audit Cognitive Processes While Reading Code

## Practice Task
Read three short programs that perform different operations, explain each one, and record which parts depended on remembered knowledge, temporary information, or active mental execution.

## Target Skill
Recognizing the cognitive source of difficulty while reading unfamiliar code instead of labeling the whole program confusing.

## Setup
Choose three short snippets in languages or notations with different familiarity levels. Do not choose three implementations of the same operation, because the first solution would supply knowledge for the later ones.

## Instructions
1. Read the first snippet and write a one-sentence behavior explanation without executing it.
2. List the syntax, algorithms, domain facts, and prior examples you retrieved from long-term memory.
3. List the names, types, and local facts you had to hold temporarily, plus any text you ignored as irrelevant.
4. Mark the expressions or state changes you mentally executed and note where processing became effortful.
5. Repeat for the other two snippets, then classify each difficulty as missing knowledge, missing information, or processing overload.
6. For one difficulty in each class, name the next action that would remove it.

## Success Check
- Every snippet has a behavior explanation supported by specific code evidence.
- The audit separates remembered knowledge, temporarily held facts, and mentally processed steps.
- Each identified difficulty has a matching response rather than a generic instruction to reread harder.

## Common Failures
- Choosing snippets that all share one algorithm, which lets knowledge from the first hide the differences in later readings.
- Recording language names instead of the exact retrieved facts, such as the meaning of an operator or the shape of a loop.
- Calling every difficult expression a knowledge gap without checking whether all needed facts were already visible.

## Notes
Exercise 1.1 uses APL, Java, and BASIC programs that perform different operations, then asks what the reader retrieved, stored, ignored, and processed. Varying both notation and operation prevents one solved example from carrying the rest of the exercise and makes the three forms of confusion easier to distinguish.
