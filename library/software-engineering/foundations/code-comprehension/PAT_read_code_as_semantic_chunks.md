# Read Code as Semantic Chunks

## Pattern Rule
**IF** reading a coherent program token by token exhausts short-term memory before its behavior becomes clear
**THEN** group familiar syntax and operations into named concepts, then reason about the relationships among those concepts rather than retaining every token separately.

## Do
- Replace a loop's individual punctuation and keywords with one remembered unit such as "iterate over the array," while checking that the actual bounds and direction match that label.
- Group a sequence of assignments that exchange two values as a swap, and combine nested control structures with known algorithm knowledge when the evidence supports that interpretation.
- Keep unfamiliar fragments separate until you can learn or inspect them; chunking depends on knowledge already stored, not on inventing a convenient label.

## Don't
- Don't measure understanding by how many source characters you can repeat; an expert often recalls fewer literal details while retaining more behavior through abstraction.
- Don't force nonsensical or scrambled code into a familiar pattern, because a false chunk hides the mismatch that should trigger closer reading.

## Checklist
- Can I name each major block with a programming or domain concept?
- Does every label account for the actual identifiers, bounds, and state changes inside its block?
- Which remaining fragments still require low-level reading because I lack the relevant concept?

## Notes
The insertion-sort reproduction and the programming analogue of de Groot's chess experiments show why expertise changes recall. Familiar syntax, algorithms, and past examples let several details occupy one short-term-memory slot; scrambled code removes those relationships and erases most of the expert advantage. The method depends on both abstraction and verification: compress the known structure, but keep details visible where they could disprove the label.
