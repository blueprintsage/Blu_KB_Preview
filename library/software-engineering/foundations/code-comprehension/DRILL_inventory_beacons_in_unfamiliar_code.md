# Inventory Beacons in Unfamiliar Code

## Practice Task
Explain one function from an unfamiliar codebase while recording every code element or natural-language cue that materially advances your understanding.

## Target Skill
Recognizing the simple and compound signals used during comprehension and distinguishing domain knowledge from functional knowledge.

## Setup
Select one method or function in an unfamiliar codebase written in a language you know. If possible, arrange for someone familiar with the code to review your explanation.

## Instructions
1. Study the function and begin a one-sentence behavior summary.
2. Whenever an identifier, comment, operator, literal, intermediate value, or structure produces an "aha" moment, stop and record it verbatim.
3. For each item, state the hypothesis it supports and whether it represents domain or program-function knowledge.
4. Combine related simple items into any compound signals you used.
5. Finish the behavior summary and verify it with tests, callers, documentation, or a knowledgeable reviewer.
6. Optionally improve a missing or misleading signal while preserving the codebase's conventions.

## Success Check
- The final explanation is confirmed by evidence outside the initial guess.
- Every recorded item names the hypothesis it supported or refuted.
- The inventory distinguishes natural language, simple code elements, and compound structures.

## Common Failures
- Listing every identifier instead of only the elements that changed understanding.
- Treating a suggestive name as proof without checking later behavior.
- Adding explanatory clutter after the exercise when the existing signals were already sufficient.

## Notes
Exercise 2.5 asks the reader to select unfamiliar code, notice each comprehension breakthrough, classify the knowledge it represents, and optionally contribute better signals. A knowledgeable peer is useful as a correctness check because a compelling beacon can still support the wrong explanation.
