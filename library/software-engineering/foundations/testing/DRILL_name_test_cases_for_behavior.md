# Split and Name Test Cases for the Behavior They Lock In

## Practice Task
Take one large test case that checks several behaviors and split it into focused cases named for each behavior, then confirm failures now pinpoint what broke.

## Target Skill
Writing focused test cases whose names and assertions make a failure self-explaining.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
1. Start from a single catch-all test case that exercises multiple behaviors under one vague name.
2. List the distinct behaviors it covers.
3. Split it into one case per behavior, each named for the specific behavior it locks in (such as a suffix describing the expected property).
4. Improve each assertion so a failure message states what is wrong — for an ordering behavior, report that contents match but order differs rather than dumping raw values.
5. Deliberately break one behavior and confirm exactly one well-named case fails with a clear message.

## Success Check
- Each behavior has its own case named for that behavior.
- Breaking one behavior fails one case, and its name identifies what broke.
- Failure messages describe the problem, not just that something differs.

## Common Failures
- Splitting the cases but leaving generic names that do not identify the behavior.
- Keeping opaque assertions whose failure output does not explain the discrepancy.

## Notes
This drills Long's `testGetEvents` versus `testGetEvents_inChronologicalOrder` contrast. The reflex is one behavior per named case with a meaningful assertion, so that the person who broke the code — often unfamiliar with it — learns from the failure exactly what went wrong.
