# Keep Unit Tests Fast and Easy to Run

## Pattern Rule
**IF** you are writing unit tests that engineers will run repeatedly
**THEN** keep them fast and easy to run, because tests are exercised constantly during development and at presubmit, and slow or awkward tests waste time and discourage testing.

## Do
- Budget for frequency: tests gate every submission and run many times while coding, so a suite that takes an hour adds an hour to even a trivial change.
- Design tests to run without heavy external setup, so they stay quick and an engineer can run them on a whim.

## Don't
- Don't let tests become slow or painful to run; when testing hurts, engineers quietly do less of it, and coverage suffers.
- Don't build in unnecessary reliance on slow real dependencies when a faster alternative would exercise the same behavior.

## Checklist
- Can the relevant tests run quickly enough to sit in a presubmit check without slowing everyone down?
- Are tests easy enough to run that engineers will actually run them often?
- Does anything make a test needlessly slow that could be trimmed without losing coverage?

## Notes
Speed is a first-class property of a good unit test because it shapes behavior: Long observes that slow, painful tests lead engineers to test less, so keeping them fast improves not just efficiency but coverage. Presubmit checks that run tests before every merge make suite speed a tax on the whole team's velocity. This property pairs with testability from chapter 1 — code designed to run in isolation is exactly the code whose tests stay fast.
