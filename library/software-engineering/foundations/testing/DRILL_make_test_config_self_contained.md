# Move Outcome-Affecting Setup Out of Shared Config

## Practice Task
Take tests whose outcomes depend on a shared configuration object, move the outcome-affecting values into each case, and show a later edit no longer silently breaks a case.

## Target Skill
Distinguishing outcome-affecting setup from irrelevant setup and keeping the former local to each case.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
1. Start from tests that share a configured object in a before-each block or constant — an order with exactly three items — where a case relies on that specific value.
2. Simulate the hazard: add a fourth item to the shared object (as a new case might) and observe that the "three items" case now silently tests four.
3. Write a helper function that builds the object with case-specific values, and have each case call it with the values that case depends on.
4. Move any genuinely irrelevant-but-required data (metadata the code ignores) into a shared constant of an immutable type.
5. Confirm each case now sets up its own outcome-affecting values and that editing one case cannot alter another.

## Success Check
- Every value that affects a case's outcome is set up within that case.
- A change made for one case cannot silently weaken another.
- Only outcome-irrelevant, required data remains shared, and it is immutable.

## Common Failures
- Replacing a shared before-each with a shared constant that still holds outcome-affecting values.
- Sharing a mutable object across cases so they interfere.

## Notes
This drills Long's postage-label example, where a shared three-item order became four and gutted the large-package case. The habit is to keep anything a test's result depends on inside that test — helper functions remove the boilerplate — and to share only what no case's outcome depends on.
