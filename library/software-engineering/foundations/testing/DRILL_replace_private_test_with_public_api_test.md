# Replace a Private-Function Test With a Public-API Behavior Test

## Practice Task
Take a test that calls a made-visible private function, rewrite it to verify the real behavior through the public API, and split the class if the public-API test proves too hard.

## Target Skill
Testing behaviors through the public API and recognizing when untestability means a class should be split.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
1. Start from a class with a private helper made "visible only for testing" and a test that calls the helper directly.
2. Name the behavior that actually matters (an application is rejected for a bad credit rating), distinct from the helper's return value.
3. Rewrite the test to trigger and verify that behavior through the public entry function, and remove the helper's added visibility.
4. If testing through the public API feels infeasible because the class does too much, extract the complex subproblem into its own class with its own public API.
5. Confirm the behavior test passes, would fail if the entry function stopped calling the helper, and survives renaming the helper.

## Success Check
- The behavior is verified through the public API, with no private function exposed.
- The test would catch the entry function failing to use the helper correctly.
- Any over-complex class has been split so each unit is testable through its own surface.

## Common Failures
- Rewriting the assertion but leaving the private function public "just in case."
- Forcing a public-API test on a class that should have been split, producing a tangled test.

## Notes
This drills Long's `MortgageAssessor` example across both fixes — test via the public `assess` function, and when the class does too much, extract a `CreditRatingChecker`. The reflex is that a private function you feel you must test is a signal to test the behavior through the public API or to split the class, never to widen visibility.
