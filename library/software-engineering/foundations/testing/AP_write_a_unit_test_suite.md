# Write a Unit Test Suite for a Piece of Code

## Objective
Produce a unit test suite that locks in every important behavior of a piece of code, stays agnostic to implementation details, and fails clearly when something breaks.

## Steps / Flow
1. **Enumerate the important behaviors.** List everything the code should do that matters — normal results, edge cases, and error scenarios — rather than planning one test per function.
2. **Plan to test each behavior through the public API.** Decide how to trigger and verify each behavior via public functions, parameters, return values, and error signals; if a behavior is important but unreachable through a narrow public API, plan to set up the needed dependency and verify the side effect.
3. **If testing via the public API is infeasible, split the code.** When a class is too complex to test through its surface, extract the tangled subproblem into its own class with its own testable public API instead of exposing private functions.
4. **Choose real dependencies, then fakes, then mocks or stubs.** Use real dependencies where feasible; substitute a fake when the real one is slow, causes real-world side effects, or is nondeterministic; fall back to a mock or stub only as a last resort. Make dependencies injectable so tests can supply doubles.
5. **Write one focused case per behavior.** Give each behavior its own descriptively named case structured as arrange, act, assert; use parameterized tests for behaviors that differ only by input, and keep outcome-affecting setup inside each case with helper functions for boilerplate.
6. **Assert with fitting matchers, then verify the suite's signals.** Pick a matcher that checks exactly the behavior and explains a failure clearly; then confirm the suite fails when a behavior breaks, survives a behavior-preserving refactoring, and runs fast enough to run often.

## Notes
This threads chapters 10 and 11 into one procedure: the good-test principles (accurate, agnostic, well-explained, understandable, fast) become the checks in steps 5 and 6, while the practices (behaviors not functions, public-API testing, splitting to test, careful shared setup, appropriate matchers, injection for testability) become the steps. The ordering matters — behaviors first because they define the suite, public-API testing before test doubles because doubles are a fallback, and signal verification last because a suite that does not fail on real breakage, or fails on refactoring, has not met its purpose.
