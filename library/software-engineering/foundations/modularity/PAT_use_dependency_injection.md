# Inject Dependencies Instead of Hard-Coding Them

## Pattern Rule
**IF** a class depends on something that could have alternative implementations
**THEN** inject that dependency through the constructor instead of constructing a specific implementation inside the class, so the class can be reconfigured with any implementation.

## Do
- Take the dependency as a constructor parameter: a `RoutePlanner` given a `RoadMap` can plan routes anywhere, where one that builds a `NorthAmericaRoadMap` internally is useless outside North America.
- Keep the easy-construction convenience with factory functions (or a dependency injection framework) that supply sensible defaults, so the default case stays a one-liner while other cases stay possible.
- Write reconfigurable subproblems as instantiable objects, not static functions; static functions cannot be injected and block test doubles (static cling), whereas an injected instance can be swapped in tests.

## Don't
- Don't construct a concrete dependency in the constructor; that hard-codes not only the implementation but its configuration, forcing arbitrary choices (online map, no seasonal roads) onto every user.
- Don't lean on a dependency injection framework without care; misconfigured, it makes it hard to tell which configuration applies where.

## Checklist
- Is each swappable dependency supplied from outside rather than built inside?
- Can a caller construct the class with an alternative implementation for a different use case or a test?
- Is a default configuration still available through a factory so construction stays easy?

## Notes
Dependency injection is the chapter's foundational modularity move and the mechanism chapter 2's refactoring AP previewed. The `RoutePlanner`/`RoadMap` example shows both the win (any region's map works) and the cost it manages (construction gets harder, softened by factory functions). The static-function trap is the subtle failure: writing the road map as static methods makes injection impossible even in hindsight, which is why designing for injectability — instantiable classes behind interfaces — matters before the need arises.
