# Replace a Hard-Coded Dependency With Injection

## Practice Task
Take a class that constructs a concrete dependency internally and refactor it to inject that dependency as an interface, then keep construction easy with a factory.

## Target Skill
Turning a hard-coded, unconfigurable dependency into an injected, interface-typed one.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
1. Start from a class that builds a specific implementation in its constructor — a route planner that constructs a North America road map.
2. Note what the hard-coding prevents: using the class in any other region, and swapping the dependency in a test.
3. Change the constructor to accept the dependency as a parameter, typed as the interface it implements (a road map), and store that.
4. Add a factory function that constructs the class with a sensible default implementation, so the common case stays a one-liner.
5. Confirm you can now construct the class with a different implementation, and that a test could pass a fake.

## Success Check
- The class no longer names any concrete implementation internally.
- The dependency is typed as an interface and supplied from outside.
- A factory still offers easy default construction, and an alternative implementation can be injected.

## Common Failures
- Injecting the concrete class instead of its interface, which restores construction flexibility but not reconfiguration.
- Leaving the dependency as static functions, which cannot be injected at all.

## Notes
This drills Long's `RoutePlanner`/`RoadMap` refactor. The habit is to treat a `new ConcreteThing()` inside a constructor as a modularity smell, and to lift it out to an injected interface — which simultaneously unlocks reconfiguration and test doubles.
