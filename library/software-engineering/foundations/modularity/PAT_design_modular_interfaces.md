# Compose Modules With Few Well-Defined Interfaces

## Pattern Rule
**IF** you are structuring code that a future requirement change may need to reconfigure or replace in parts
**THEN** break it into self-contained modules whose interactions with each neighbor happen in a single place through a well-defined interface with as few points of interaction as possible.

## Do
- Favor the "single peg and hole" interface — one clean point of interaction — over the "twenty interwoven threads" interface that entangles a component with the rest of the system.
- Confine the interaction between two adjacent modules to one location, so changing one piece of functionality does not require edits scattered all over the place.

## Don't
- Don't stitch functionality together so that swapping one part (a new hand that now needs fingers) means cutting many connections and re-stitching new ones, damaging the surrounding work.
- Don't spread the coupling between two modules across many scattered call sites where a single interface would do.

## Checklist
- Can you replace one module without touching the others?
- Is each inter-module interaction confined to one well-defined interface?
- If a new requirement lands on one component, does the change stay contained to it?

## Notes
The two toys make the cost concrete: the modular toy swaps a hand at a single peg-and-hole; the stitched toy needs twenty threads cut and re-sewn, with collateral damage, and the same laborious work again to undo it. Long ties modularity to adaptability and comprehension — well-defined, few-point interfaces localize change and make code easier to reason about. This is the "modular" pillar's foundation; chapters 2 and 8 specialize it into layers of abstraction and concrete techniques like dependency injection and interface-based dependencies.
