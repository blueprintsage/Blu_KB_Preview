# Judge Code Against the Four Quality Goals

## Pattern Rule
**IF** you are deciding whether a piece of code is actually good — while writing it, reviewing it, or before submitting it
**THEN** judge it against four concrete goals instead of a gut reaction: (1) it works and meets *all* requirements; (2) it keeps working as surrounding code and requirements change; (3) it is adaptable to changing requirements; (4) it does not reinvent the wheel.

## Do
- Fold non-functional requirements — latency, CPU usage, privacy, security — into goal 1: code that implements the feature but blows the latency budget does not "work."
- Treat "keeps working" as its own design concern, because code depends on other code that will be modified, updated, and changed around it.
- When code triggers a "yuck" or "this is excellent" reaction, trace the reaction to which of the four goals it helps or harms, turning a subjective feeling into an objective call.

## Don't
- Don't equate code quality with nit-picky advice about trivial things; the goals exist to create better software, not to police style trivia.
- Don't assume code that runs today will still run tomorrow — a dependency change, a new feature, or an evolving problem can break it.

## Checklist
- Can you name which of the four goals a given change advances?
- Are performance, security, and privacy requirements included in your definition of "working"?
- Have you asked how this code behaves when the code around it changes?

## Notes
Long frames code quality as inherently subjective — "yuck" versus "excellent" gut reactions — and makes it objective by stepping back to what he is really trying to achieve: work, keep working, adapt, and not reinvent the wheel. The goals deliberately absorb concerns engineers sometimes file separately: performance and security are part of "working," and durability under change ("keep working") is called out because code does not live in isolation. This is the evaluative foundation the book's six pillars and later chapters build specific techniques on.
