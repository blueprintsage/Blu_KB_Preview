    when_not_to_use: When no suitable standard/TR1/Boost facility exists, or an added dependency is unacceptable.

# Reuse Existing Solutions Instead of Reinventing

## Pattern Rule
**IF** a subproblem you face — reading bytes from a file, parsing an image format, low-level system communication — is likely already solved by the language or an existing library
**THEN** call the existing built-in or library rather than writing your own, and conversely structure the solutions you do write so other engineers can reuse them.

## Do
- Break the big problem into subproblems first (load bytes, parse to image, transform, encode, save), then check each subproblem against existing solutions before writing any of it.
- Weigh the four concrete benefits: it saves time (a few lines versus thousands and days of reading standards docs), lowers bug risk (existing code is already tested in the wild), inherits maintainers' expertise (they track changes like new JPEG encodings), and stays familiar (engineers recognize the standard approach).

## Don't
- Don't hand-roll low-level logic such as filesystem I/O or image parsing that a mature, maintained library already provides.
- Don't write your subproblem solution in a shape only you can call — leave it reusable so the next engineer doesn't reinvent it.

## Checklist
- For each subproblem, did you look for a built-in or library before coding it?
- Is the code you wrote for a subproblem structured so another engineer could reuse it?

## Notes
Long uses loading, grayscaling, and saving an image to show that most subproblems are already solved by the platform or a library. The rule runs both directions: consume others' solved subproblems, and expose your own solutions for reuse. This is goal 4 ("don't reinvent the wheel") made operational; the producing side is developed further under reusability and generalizability.

Variant `v_cpp_know_standard_library_and_tr1` (Effective C++, Items 54-55) supplies the C++ prerequisite for reuse: you cannot reach for existing solutions you do not know exist, so become familiar with the standard library and TR1 (smart pointers, function, bind, hash-based containers, algorithms) and with Boost, then prefer those vetted, portable, maintained facilities over hand-rolled equivalents. Use this emphasis when picking how to implement a C++ subproblem; the component inventories themselves are reference material, not skills, and were left unextracted.
