# Fail Fast So Errors Surface Near Their Source

## Pattern Rule
**IF** an error condition is detected, such as a function receiving an invalid argument
**THEN** signal it immediately, as close to the real source as possible, rather than letting execution carry on until the bad state causes a failure somewhere far away later.

## Do
- Throw at the entry point: reject an invalid input the moment the function is called, so a stack trace points at the exact line, instead of surfacing three classes away with no trail back.
- Value fast failure for both error classes — it gives a recoverable error the best chance of graceful recovery and an unrecoverable one the best chance of quick diagnosis.

## Don't
- Don't let code limp on past a detected error; a delayed failure can mean saving corrupted data to a database and only noticing months later, after real data is destroyed.
- Don't scatter invalid data forward through several callers, forcing an engineer to work backward across the codebase to find where it actually went wrong.

## Checklist
- Does an invalid input fail at the function boundary, not deep in downstream logic?
- Would a stack trace from the failure point at or near the true source?
- Can bad state propagate silently before anything complains?

## Notes
The truffle-dog analogy anchors it: a dog that barks the instant it finds a truffle is far more useful than one that wanders ten meters first, just as code that barks at the real source of a bug beats code that barks somewhere distant. Long pairs fail-fast (surface near the source) with fail-loud (make sure it is noticed); this pattern is the location half, and it is the same instinct behind runtime contract checks that reject bad inputs up front.
