# Return a Result Type to Convey the Error's Cause

## Pattern Rule
**IF** a function can fail and the caller needs to know not just that a value could not be produced but why
**THEN** return a result type that holds either a value or an error, so the return type itself makes the possible error explicit and carries the failure detail.

## Do
- Build the type to hold exactly one of value or error: a private constructor plus static `ofValue()` and `ofError()` factories prevents an instance that has both or neither, and a `hasError()` gate tells the caller which it holds.
- Make the caller's usage clear — check `hasError()` first, then `getValue()` on success or `getError()` for the encapsulated detail, such as the erroneous number that caused the failure.
- Lean on built-in support where it exists — Swift, Rust, and F# provide result types with cleaner syntax and transform helpers like Rust's `and_then` — and take those as models for a hand-rolled version.

## Don't
- Don't reach for a result type when the caller needs no reason for the failure; a nullable return is simpler there, and the result type's benefit is the error detail.
- Don't assume a hand-rolled result type is self-explanatory; if a colleague does not know to call `hasError()` before `getValue()`, the safety is lost, so keep its usage conventional.

## Checklist
- Does the return type itself reveal that an error is possible?
- Can the value and error states never both be present or both absent?
- Does the caller get actionable detail about why the failure happened?

## Notes
The result type answers the one thing a bare null or optional cannot: the reason for failure. Long's worked `getSquareRoot` returns a `Result` of value-or-`NegativeNumberError`, the error object carrying the offending number for debugging and a UI message. The private-constructor-plus-factories construction is what guarantees the invariant of exactly-one-of, and pointing at the mature Rust and Swift implementations signals that real result types add ergonomic transform helpers on top of this core.
