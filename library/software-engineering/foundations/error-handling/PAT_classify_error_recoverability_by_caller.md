# Classify Error Recoverability From the Caller's Position

## Pattern Rule
**IF** an error can occur in a function and you must decide whether to treat it as recoverable or fatal
**THEN** recognize the answer is context-dependent and usually only the caller knows, so as the function's author assume an error caused by supplied input is one a caller may want to recover from — unless the contract makes the input obviously invalid and trivially checkable before the call.

## Do
- Distinguish the two classes: errors from something external (invalid user input, network down, corrupt file) are usually recoverable by the system as a whole; errors from a programming mistake (missing bundled resource, invalid hard-coded argument, missing initialization) usually are not.
- Read recoverability off the call site: `PhoneNumber.parse("01234typo56789")` with a hard-coded literal is an unrecoverable programming error, while `PhoneNumber.parse(userInput)` is recoverable and deserves a friendly UI message.
- Default to "caller might want to recover" whenever you lack complete knowledge of every call site, or there is any chance the code will be reused later.

## Don't
- Don't assume an input error is a fatal programming error just because it is obvious to you; the invalidity may be buried in small print the caller never read.
- Don't decide recoverability at the low level where the error is detected — that layer is often not the one that knows how it should be handled.

## Checklist
- Could this error arise from external input rather than a programming mistake?
- Do you actually know every caller and the origin of every value they pass?
- If reused tomorrow, would your recoverable/unrecoverable assumption still hold?

## Notes
Long's phone-number example makes recoverability a property of context rather than of the error itself: the same `parse` failure is fatal from a hard-coded typo and recoverable from user input. Because a function author rarely controls all callers, the safe default is to treat input-caused errors as potentially recoverable and signal them, reserving "unrecoverable" for cases where the contract makes the invalidity obvious and the caller can cheaply check it first — a negative list index being the archetype.
