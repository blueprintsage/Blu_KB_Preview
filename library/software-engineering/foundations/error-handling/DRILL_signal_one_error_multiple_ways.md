# Signal One Error Several Ways and Compare the Tradeoffs

## Practice Task
Take one small function with a single error case and rewrite its signaling several ways, then compare which are explicit and what each conveys.

## Target Skill
Fluency in the error-signaling techniques and the ability to judge their tradeoffs.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
1. Start from a function with one clear error case — the classic is a square-root function that errors on a negative input.
2. Write a version for each technique: a checked exception, an unchecked exception, a nullable return under null safety, a result type carrying an error object, and a magic value such as returning minus one.
3. For each version, also write the caller, and mark whether the caller is forced to acknowledge the error or is free to ignore it.
4. Label each technique explicit or implicit, and note what information it conveys — in particular which ones carry a reason for the failure and which do not.
5. Pick which you would ship for a recoverable error and justify it against forced awareness and error detail.

## Success Check
- Each version compiles in your head as a coherent function-plus-caller pair.
- Checked exception, nullable, and result are labeled explicit; unchecked exception and magic value are labeled implicit.
- Your final choice is justified by forced caller awareness and by whether error detail is needed.

## Common Failures
- Treating an unchecked exception as explicit because it can be caught — the caller is not forced to know it exists.
- Choosing a nullable return when the caller needs the failure reason, which only a result type carries.

## Notes
This is Long's `getSquareRoot` walkthrough turned into deliberate practice. Writing the same error five ways makes the explicit/implicit distinction concrete and exposes the real axis of choice: whether the caller is forced to acknowledge the error, and whether the technique can carry why it happened. That comparison is what informs the recoverable-error signaling decision.
