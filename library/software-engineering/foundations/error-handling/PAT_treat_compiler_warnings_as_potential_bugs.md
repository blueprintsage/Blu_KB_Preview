# Treat Compiler Warnings as Potential Bugs

## Pattern Rule
**IF** the compiler emits a warning about your code
**THEN** treat it as an early sign of a possible bug and act on it — fix the underlying issue, or suppress that specific warning with a documented reason — rather than dismissing it because the code still compiles.

## Do
- Read what the warning is really telling you: "private member `displayName` can be removed as the value assigned to it is never read" is the compiler pointing straight at a `getDisplayName()` that wrongly returns the real name.
- Configure warnings as errors where you can, so warnings cannot be silently ignored and every one must be addressed.
- When a warning is genuinely a false alarm, suppress just that warning with an explanation — a targeted `@Suppress("unused")` plus a comment and an issue link — never by turning warnings off wholesale.

## Don't
- Don't dismiss warnings as unimportant because the build passed; an ignored one here hides a bug that leaks a user's real name in place of their display name.
- Don't silence warnings globally to make them go away; suppress the specific case and record why.

## Checklist
- Has every compiler warning been either fixed or explicitly suppressed with a reason?
- Does each suppression name why it is safe, ideally with a tracking link?
- Are warnings configured to fail the build so none slip through unnoticed?

## Notes
Long's `UserInfo` example shows a warning catching a real, privacy-violating bug that tests might have missed: an unused-field warning is the visible symptom of a getter returning the wrong field. The rule extends the chapter-3 idea of making breakage fail at compile time — warnings are the compiler's softer signal of suspicious code, and the disciplined end state is a clean build where every warning has been fixed or suppressed with a documented, valid reason.

Variant `v_cpp_warnings_implementation_dependent` (Effective C++, Item 53) adds a C++-specific caveat: a compiler warning that "D::f() hides virtual B::f()" is really flagging a botched override (a const mismatch that hides rather than redefines the base function), so understand each warning before dismissing it — but because warnings are implementation-dependent, compile warning-free at the maximum level while never *depending* on a given warning to catch a mistake, since another compiler may accept the same code silently. Use this emphasis when writing portable C++ across compilers.
