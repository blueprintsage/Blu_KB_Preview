# Make a Type-Specific Class Generic

## Practice Task
Take a container class hard-coded to one element type and rewrite it with a generic placeholder, then use it with two different types.

## Target Skill
Replacing a hard-coded element type with a generic type placeholder to generalize a container.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
1. Start from a container hard-coded to one type — a randomized queue that stores only strings.
2. Confirm the limitation: a near-identical need for a different type (pictures instead of words) cannot reuse it.
3. Introduce a type placeholder on the class and replace every hard-coded occurrence of the element type with that placeholder, in fields, parameters, and return types.
4. Instantiate the class with two different concrete types and confirm both work from the same code.
5. Check the nullable edge: if the container returns null to signal empty, decide whether storing nullable elements needs a separate has-next check.

## Success Check
- No concrete element type remains hard-coded in the class.
- The same class stores two different types at two call sites.
- The empty-versus-null-element ambiguity is considered and handled if relevant.

## Common Failures
- Replacing the type in some places but leaving a hard-coded occurrence that defeats the generalization.
- Overlooking that a nullable element type collides with a null empty-signal.

## Notes
This drills Long's `RandomizedQueue` generalization from a string-only queue to one parameterized by a type placeholder. The habit is to notice when a class references a type it does not truly care about, and to lift that type to a placeholder so one implementation serves every element type.
