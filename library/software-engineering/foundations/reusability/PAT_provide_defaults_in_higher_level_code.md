# Provide Default Values in Higher-Level Code

## Pattern Rule
**IF** a low-level component could substitute a default when a value is absent
**THEN** have it report the absence (return null or an optional) and let higher-level code supply the default, rather than baking the default into the low-level code.

## Do
- Return absence from the low level: a settings class with no user-chosen font should return null, not silently return Arial.
- Make defaulting its own subproblem solved higher up: a dedicated defaults provider plus a settings layer that chooses between the user value and the default keeps that decision reconfigurable, ideally via dependency injection.
- Use the language's null-coalescing operator where available to keep the "user value or default" choice concise.

## Don't
- Don't hard-code a default deep in low-level code; every layer above then inherits the assumption that this default is sensible, and the lower the level, the more code that assumption constrains.
- Don't force one default on all callers when different reuses of the code may need different defaults.

## Checklist
- Does a low-level component decide a default that higher layers should own?
- Is absence reported upward so callers can each choose their own default?
- Is the defaulting logic reconfigurable rather than fixed at the lowest level?

## Notes
A default value is an assumption about every layer above, and the deeper it sits, the more code it silently binds. Long's `UserDocumentSettings` returning Arial is the trap: reusing that code inherits Arial whether it suits or not. Returning null and lifting the default into a `DocumentSettings` layer (with the provider injected) turns defaulting into a distinct, reconfigurable subproblem, so each caller picks its own — the reusability-focused counterpart to the earlier warnings against default and magic return values.
