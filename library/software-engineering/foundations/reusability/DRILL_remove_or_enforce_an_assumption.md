# Remove an Unnecessary Assumption or Enforce a Necessary One

## Practice Task
Take code with an unenforced assumption, decide whether to remove or enforce it, and apply the fix — naming it so callers opt in when the assumption stays.

## Target Skill
Judging whether a baked-in assumption is necessary, and either generalizing past it or enforcing and naming it.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
1. Start from code with an assumption mentioned only in a comment — an image lookup that assumes an article has at most one image section.
2. Write the general version that drops the assumption (return images from all sections) and note the cost (a few extra iterations) versus the reuse benefit.
3. Now suppose a specific caller genuinely needs the single-section assumption; enforce it with an assertion or check so a violation fails fast.
4. Rename the function to advertise the assumption (getOnlyImageSection) so callers who do not want it steer clear.
5. Decide the enforcement by data source: assertion for internally generated data, an explicit error signal for user- or externally supplied data.

## Success Check
- The unnecessary version handles the general case rather than assuming.
- The necessary version fails fast on a violated assumption and names the assumption.
- The enforcement mechanism matches whether the error is recoverable.

## Common Failures
- Leaving the assumption in a comment where reusing callers never see it.
- Asserting on externally supplied data that a caller would reasonably want to recover from.

## Notes
This drills Long's article example across both branches — remove the assumption when it only saves a little work, enforce and name it when a use case truly requires it. The discriminator for enforcement is recoverability: a programming error deserves an assertion, external input deserves an explicit signal.
