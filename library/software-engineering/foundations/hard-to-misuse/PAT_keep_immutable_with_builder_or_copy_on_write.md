# Keep Classes Immutable With Builder or Copy-on-Write

## Pattern Rule
**IF** a class needs to stay immutable but has optional construction values, or callers need a slightly modified version of an instance
**THEN** reach for a design pattern rather than adding setters — the builder pattern for optional values, or the copy-on-write pattern for modified copies.

## Do
- Use a builder when some values are optional: a mutable builder takes required values in its constructor and optional ones through chained setters, then `build()` returns the immutable object — so an invalid object cannot be constructed and no runtime check is needed.
- Use copy-on-write when callers need a tweaked instance: `with`-style functions (`withFontSize`) return a new object with one value changed and leave the original untouched, backed by a private all-values constructor.
- Prefer copy-on-write over the builder when getting modified copies is the common need, as prepopulating a builder from an existing instance is more cumbersome.

## Don't
- Don't add setters to make optional values or modified copies convenient; that reintroduces the mutability the class was made immutable to avoid.
- Don't require a caller to specify every optional value in one giant constructor; that is exactly the unwieldiness the builder exists to remove.

## Checklist
- Are optional values handled by a builder rather than by mutating the built object?
- Do modified copies come from copy-on-write functions that leave the original unchanged?
- Is it impossible to build an instance missing a required value?

## Notes
These are the two escape hatches that keep immutability practical. The builder splits `TextOptions` into a mutable `TextOptionsBuilder` and an immutable result, taking the required font in the builder's constructor so an invalid build cannot compile — a compile-time guarantee superior to a runtime check. Copy-on-write instead adds `withFont`/`withFontSize` that each mint a new instance, letting `renderTitle` get an 18-point copy without touching the caller's object. Both preserve the tamper-proof seal while restoring the flexibility that plain construction-only immutability lacks.
