# Replace an Overly General Type With a Dedicated Type

## Practice Task
Take code that represents a structured concept with a general type and replace it with a dedicated type, then confirm the misuse it enabled no longer compiles.

## Target Skill
Recognizing when a general container hides a specific concept and defining a dedicated type for it.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
1. Start from code that uses a general type for a specific concept — a location as a list of two doubles, and a collection of locations as a list of lists of doubles.
2. List the misuses it allows: the type explains nothing, latitude and longitude can be swapped, and a list with the wrong number of values still compiles.
3. Define a small dedicated type — a class with named latitude and longitude fields.
4. Change the function signatures to take the dedicated type, and update callers.
5. Try to reproduce the earlier misuses and confirm they now fail to compile or are impossible, and that the documentation explaining the shape is no longer needed.

## Success Check
- The signature names the concept, so no documentation is needed to interpret it.
- Swapping the two fields or supplying the wrong number of values no longer compiles.
- Callers read self-explanatorily, using named accessors rather than positional indices.

## Common Failures
- Reaching for a pair type as the fix, which enforces the count but still does not name or order the fields.
- Leaving one caller on the old general type, forcing the hacky representation to persist.

## Notes
This drills Long's map-location ladder from a list of doubles through a pair to a dedicated `LatLong` class. The habit is to treat an unlabeled general container for a specific concept as a defect, and to spend the few minutes a dedicated type costs before the general representation spreads across the codebase.
