# Prefer Immutable Objects Set Only at Construction

## Pattern Rule
**IF** you are designing a class whose instances will be passed around to other code
**THEN** default to making it immutable — take all values at construction, mark the members final (const/readonly), and provide no setters — so no other code can change it after creation, making it mutable only where mutation is genuinely required.

## Do
- Remove setter functions and set every member in the constructor; marking `font` and `fontSize` final stops even code inside the class from reassigning them and signals they never change.
- Treat immutability as a tamper-proof seal: an immutable object can be passed anywhere with certainty that no caller altered it, the way a sealed juice carton guarantees its contents.
- Lean on immutability for thread safety — a mutable object read by one thread while another modifies it is a classic source of concurrency bugs that immutability removes.

## Don't
- Don't expose setters on a value class; a `renderTitle` that calls `setFontSize(18)` on a shared instance silently changes the font size seen by the next caller.
- Don't make things mutable by default "just in case"; mutable objects are harder to reason about, so reserve mutability for the parts of the code that must track changing state.

## Checklist
- Can any code change this object's state after construction?
- Are all members final and set once, with no setter functions?
- Would passing this object to another function risk it being mutated underneath you?

## Notes
This is the core hard-to-misuse technique the book pointed toward from chapters 3 and 6. The `TextOptions` setter bug is the anchor: a shared instance mutated by one render call corrupts the next, and removing setters plus final members makes that impossible. Immutability also answers the reason-about-it and multithreading concerns raised earlier. The one wrinkle — needing an optional value or a modified copy — is handled by the builder and copy-on-write patterns rather than by reintroducing mutability.
