# Remove a Redundant Second Source of Truth From a Data Model

## Practice Task
Take a class that stores both primary data and a value derived from it, show it can be built in an inconsistent state, and refactor so the derived value is computed instead.

## Target Skill
Separating primary from derived data and removing stored derived values that create a second source of truth.

## Setup
No special setup required.

## Instructions
1. Start from a class that takes and stores primary values and a derived one — an account taking credit, debit, and balance.
2. Construct an instance in an inconsistent state (balance as debit minus credit) and confirm it compiles and stores contradictory data.
3. Identify which fields are primary (credit, debit) and which are derived (balance).
4. Remove the derived field from the constructor and members, and compute it on demand in the getter (credit minus debit).
5. Confirm an inconsistent instance can no longer be constructed, and, if you want to practice the expensive case, replace the primary values with a transaction list and add lazy caching under immutability.

## Success Check
- The class no longer accepts the derived value as a parameter.
- Building an inconsistent instance is impossible, not merely discouraged.
- Any cached derived value is guarded by immutability so it cannot disagree with the primary data.

## Common Failures
- Keeping the derived field but "validating" it in the constructor, which is weaker than making the bad state unrepresentable.
- Caching a derived value in a mutable class without resetting the cache on mutation.

## Notes
This drills Long's `UserAccount` example, where storing balance alongside credit and debit lets an off-by-sign caller ship wrong statements. Deriving on demand makes the inconsistent state impossible; the lazy-cache extension shows why the single-source-of-truth and immutability rules reinforce each other when derivation is costly.
