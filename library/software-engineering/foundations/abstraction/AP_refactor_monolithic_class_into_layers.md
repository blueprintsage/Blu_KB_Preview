# Refactor a Monolithic Class Into Clean Layered Abstractions

## Objective
Transform a class that has grown to solve several subproblems into a set of cohesive, independently reusable and testable classes with clean layers of abstraction, without leaking implementation details.

## Steps / Flow
1. **Identify the subproblems.** Read the class and list every distinct subproblem it solves internally, including nested ones — for a text summarizer: splitting text into paragraphs, scoring importance, and beneath scoring, finding important nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
2. **Diagnose against the pillars.** For each pillar (readable, modular, reusable, testable), name a concrete way the monolith fails it, to confirm the split is worth doing and to target where the seams belong.
3. **Extract one class per concept.** Move each subproblem's logic into its own class with a single cohesive concern (a `ParagraphFinder`, a `TextImportanceScorer`), each exposing only the public functions its layer needs.
4. **Inject dependencies through the constructor.** Have the top class receive the extracted classes as constructor parameters rather than creating them internally, and provide a static factory (`createDefault`) so callers get a wired instance easily.
5. **Extract an interface where implementations will vary.** If a subproblem has more than one plausible approach, turn its class into an interface with an implementation per approach (word-based vs model-based scoring), let the top class depend only on the interface, and configure the choice via factory functions.
6. **Check layer thickness.** Confirm no extracted layer is so thin that its pieces only ever serve each other; if so, merge back. When unsure, leave layers slightly thin rather than thick, and expect a few iterations before the layering settles.

## Notes
This is the chapter's worked refactoring, generalized: the `TextSummarizer` moves from a monolith (everything in one class) to one-class-per-concept with constructor injection, then to an interface-backed scorer with factory wiring, while the too-thin `OffsetDetector` split marks the stopping point. Steps 4 and 5 name dependency injection and interface extraction, which chapter 8 develops in depth; here they are the mechanics that turn a diagnosed monolith into clean layers. Apply it both to code that arrived bloated and to a class you notice growing while you modify it.
