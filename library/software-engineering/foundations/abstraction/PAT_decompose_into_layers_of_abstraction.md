# Decompose a Problem Into Clean Layers of Abstraction

## Pattern Rule
**IF** you face a problem at any level, from "let users share photos" down to "add two numbers"
**THEN** break it recursively into subproblems and structure the code as layers, where each layer solves its subproblem using only a few concepts and treats the layer beneath it as an abstract capability it need not understand.

## Do
- Aim for the property the `HttpConnection.connect(...).send(...).close()` example shows: three lines exposing four concepts (a URL, a connection, a send, a close) while hiding TCP, HTTP, radio modulation, and error correction entirely.
- Separate subproblems you must be aware of from ones you need not be — the top layer sends a string; it does not know whether the user is on WiFi or cellular.
- Keep recursing until no individual piece of code deals with more than a few easily-comprehended concepts at a time.

## Don't
- Don't force higher-level code to know how a lower layer is implemented; that coupling is the sign the layers are not clean.
- Don't dump a whole problem and all its subproblems into one undivided unit just because the top-level statement sounds like "one thing."

## Checklist
- Does each unit deal with only a handful of concepts?
- Can you describe the top layer without referring to how any lower layer works?
- Have others' solved subproblems (libraries, platform) been treated as abstract layers rather than reimplemented?

## Notes
This is the chapter's central idea and the mechanism behind four pillars at once: clean layers make code readable (few concepts per layer), modular (swap a layer without touching others — WiFi vs cellular module), reusable and generalizable (a TCP layer also serves WebSockets), and testable (each subproblem's soundness can be checked like a surveyor checking a house's foundations). The constructs that realize layers — functions, classes, interfaces — are the subjects of the more specific patterns from this chapter.
