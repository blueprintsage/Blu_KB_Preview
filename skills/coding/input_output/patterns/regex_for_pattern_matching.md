## Pattern Rule
**IF** text matching is pattern-based and regular,  
**THEN** use regex,  
**ELSE** hand parsing may be clearer for structured grammars.

## Do
- Apply the rule at the smallest useful scope.
- Prefer standard, type-safe C++ expression.
- Preserve the primary skill goal.

## Don't
- Convert the rule into ceremony.
- Let a secondary concern override the main design intent.

## Checklist
- The condition is present.
- The action improves correctness, clarity, or performance.
- The fallback prevents overuse.

## Variants

### Variant: Legacy Codebase
**IF** the same pattern appears in pre-C++11 or C-style code  
**THEN** preserve behavior while modernizing the interface  
**ELSE** use the modern base form directly

## PASS Variant Absorption — Boost C++ Application Development Cookbook

- Absorbed variant: Boost string algorithms vs std regex/string_view
- Absorbed as: variant/refinement note
- Source handling: transformed idea only; no source prose copied.
- Modernization: treat Boost-era mechanics as either standard-library migration targets or Boost-specific tools when the standard library still lacks equivalent coverage.
