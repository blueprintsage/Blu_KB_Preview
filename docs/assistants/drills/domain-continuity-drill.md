[ ] Read docs/worklogs/assignments.md and claim the assignment
[ ] Read docs/domains/<domain>/index.md
[ ] Read worklog.md

[ ] Update worklog.md (what changed / tested / worked / failed / risks / next / files)
[ ] Update decisions.md if a decision was made or reversed
[ ] Update failures.md if anything was tried and abandoned
